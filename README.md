# Random-Chapter
 Just some code for a random book chapter system if someone wants to create it. It includes mySQL database connection upload code, and supports series. Pre-loaded with Harry Potter and A Song of Ice and Fire.

I don't have a dynamic hosting service right now, so I can't make this (just using Github Pages).
